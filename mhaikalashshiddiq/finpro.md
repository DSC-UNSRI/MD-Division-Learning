## üìù Final Project Plan

### 1. Project Title
**LinguaPanel** - Comic Translation Mobile Application

---

### 2. Chosen Final Project Deliverable
- [x] **Mobile App on GitHub Repository (without publishing)**  

**Explanation:** I chose GitHub repository option because this is a complete mobile application with complex features that just too much work for pubkishing. The app includes authentication, image processing, API integration, and local storage management - making it suitable for showcasing technical capabilities without the complexity of app stores publishing.

- **Justification:** LinguaPanel supports cross-language literacy access, helping comic readers from different countries understand content without language barriers. This aligns with SDG 4's goal to improve global access to education and literacy, making educational and entertainment content more accessible across cultures.
