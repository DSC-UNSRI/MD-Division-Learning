## üìù Final Project Plan

### 1. Project Title
**EcoTrack: Daily Carbon Footprint Logger**

---

### 2. Chosen Final Project Deliverable
- [x] Mobile App on GitHub Repository (without publishing)  
- [ ] Flutter/Dart Package published on pub.dev  
- [ ] Mobile App published on Google Play Store  

**Reasoning:**  
The goal is to build a focused Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates core competencies in mobile development, including UI/UX, state management, and backend integration. A GitHub repository is the ideal deliverable to showcase a well-structured, clean codebase and a functional app for a portfolio, without the overhead of publishing to a store.

### 3. Problem Statement & SDG Alignment
**Problem Statement:**  
Many individuals lack awareness of how their daily activities contribute to their personal carbon footprint. There is a need for a simple, accessible tool to help users track their impact, understand the consequences of their choices, and receive guidance on living more sustainably.

**Chosen SDG:**  
**SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production**

**Justification:**  
"EcoTrack" directly supports SDG 12 by focusing on:

- **Target 12.8:** Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. By providing a tool for tracking and visualizing personal carbon impact, the app raises awareness and educates users on the environmental consequences of their daily choices.
- **Encouraging Sustainable Lifestyles:** The act of logging activities and seeing the resulting impact incentivizes users to make more conscious, eco-friendly decisions in their daily lives, promoting responsible consumption patterns. The direct feedback loop provides a powerful motivator for behavioral change.

---

### 4. Target Users & Use Cases
**Target Users:**
- Individuals new to sustainability who want to understand their environmental impact.
- Anyone interested in personal data tracking for self-improvement.

**Use Cases:**
- **Activity Logging:** A user logs their daily activities (e.g., commute distance, energy consumption, meals) into the app.  
- **Impact Visualization:** The user views their Home Dashboard to see a simple summary of their carbon footprint for the day or week.  
- **Historical Review:** The user browses their "Carbon Log" to see a complete history of their entries, allowing them to identify patterns and track progress over time.  
- **Account Management:** The user creates an account, logs in securely, and manages their profile settings.  

---

### 5. Features List
- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality.  
- **Home Dashboard:** A personalized landing page showing a summary of carbon impact.  
- **Daily Activity Logging:** A dedicated form for users to input different types of activities.  
- **Carbon Log History:** A list view displaying all past entries, with options to read, update, and delete each entry (full CRUD).  
- **User Profile Page:** A screen for users to view their account information and log out.  
- **Splash/Onboarding Screen:** An introductory screen that welcomes the user to the application.  
- **Leaderboard:** A competitive leaderboard to engage users and encourage consistent tracking.  
- **AI-Powered Daily Tips:** Dynamic and relevant sustainability tips generated by an AI.  

---

### 6. Technical Details
**Architecture Pattern:**  
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate UI from business logic, ensuring the code is organized, testable, and maintainable.

**Key Packages/Dependencies:**
- **Frontend Framework:** Flutter  
- **Authentication:** `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`  
- **Backend & DB:** `supabase` for all database operations  
- **Database/Storage:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for real-time data (user profiles, activity logs, leaderboards)  

---

### 7. Deliverable-Specific Requirements
If GitHub Repo (App without publishing):
- The project will consist of a **10-page mobile application**.  
- Each page will contain a **minimum of 5 distinct widgets**.  
- The app will demonstrate backend integration for authentication and CRUD operations.  
- The repository will include **APK builds for demonstration purposes** (e.g., `arm64-v8a`).  
- The code will be **well-structured and documented**, meeting first-stage production quality.  

---

### 8. Complexity Plan
The technical ambition of this project is centered on the integration of a hybrid backend system and advanced features:

- **Hybrid Backend Architecture:**  
  Firebase Authentication for user management, Supabase for database operations. This requires careful handling of user IDs and security rules across both platforms.  

- **Real-time Leaderboard:**  
  Using Supabase's real-time subscription capabilities to ensure scores are updated instantly across all users.  

- **AI-Driven Daily Tips:**  
  Implementing AI-generated tips to provide engaging and relevant content.  

---

### 9. Timeline & Milestones
**Weeks 1‚Äì2: Leaderboard Feature & Backend Setup**  
- Initialize and configure Firebase (Auth) and Supabase (Database).  
- Design and build the leaderboard UI.  
- Implement logic for calculating and updating user scores using Supabase real-time subscriptions.  

**Weeks 3‚Äì4: AI-Powered Daily Tips Feature**  
- Research and implement the AI solution for generating tips.  
- Develop the service for fetching daily tips.  
- Display the tips dynamically on the Home Dashboard.  

**Week 5: Achievements & Badges Page**  
- Design the UI for achievements and badges.  
- Implement the logic to award badges based on user activity and milestones stored in Supabase.  

**Week 6: Finalization & Documentation**  
- Conduct final testing and bug fixing across the application.  
- Prepare the project documentation and a comprehensive README for the repository.
